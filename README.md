# Documentation
I apologize if this is a bit sloppy or hard to follow, as this is my first time writing documentation for something like this.
Shard is an open-source programming language that you can use to indirectly run Turbowarp blocks. It is related to another project I am working on, TurbOS, that includes a shell and Shard interpreter.
This repository includes documentation for Shard, a TurbOS dev kernel that you can write your own projects ontop of, and some example Shard programs that you can run.

# Rules
I am fine with you using my TurbOS dev kernel, as long as you:
- Credit me for making the dev kernel.
- Give credit to anyone else who's work you may have used, including Turbowarp extensions.
- Keep the initialization screen untouched (with the exception of adding your own logo in the middle, which I am okay with).
- Follow the rules of the GPL v3.0 License. (if you don't know the rules of this license, then please do not use my work until you do).
- Avoid making anything that could be considered NSFW.
